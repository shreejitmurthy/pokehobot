# PokeHo Bot
Pokeho Bot is a Discord bot that was made for a group with a couple of friends during our Pokémon Card phase. The code is outdated as discord.py has changed their API. In addition to this, the code is terribly made, with a huge line of if-elif statements. This bot was developed in 2022, ~1 year after I learned Python, so the method's in place is pretty naïve.

That being said, it did contain some cool functions:
- Card Price Checker utilising the Pokemon TCG SDK
- Trade worth checker, determining if a certain trade is worth it.
- Higher/Lower price minigame
- Maybe something else that I am forgetting.

The only reason I uploaded this project to GitHub is because I like looking back on it, and it was a project I was pretty passionate about so it seems fair I keep it safe.
